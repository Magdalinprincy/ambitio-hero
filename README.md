# Hero Section - Ambitio Landing Page

## Project Overview
This project is a responsive hero section implementation for Ambitio's landing page, developed as part of the Frontend Developer Intern assignment. The hero section has been created with pixel-perfect accuracy based on the provided Figma design.

## Technical Stack
- **Framework**: React.js
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Animations**: Framer Motion

## Features
- **Pixel-Perfect Design Implementation**: The hero section closely matches the Figma design, including layout, typography, colors, and spacing.
- **Responsive Design**: Fully responsive across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices with custom breakpoints.
- **Smooth Animations**: Integrated subtle and engaging animations to enhance user experience:
  - Fade-in and slide-up animations for the main heading and stats section
  - Hover effects on buttons and interactive elements
  - Responsive navigation with mobile menu toggle

## Development Approach
1. **Design Analysis**: First, I analyzed the Figma design to understand the layout structure, component hierarchy, and styling requirements.

2. **Component Structure**: Created a modular component structure with the main HeroSection component.

3. **Responsive Implementation**: Used Tailwind CSS utility classes and media queries to ensure the hero section looks great on all screen sizes.

4. **Animations**: Integrated Framer Motion for smooth, performant animations that enhance the user experience without being distracting.

5. **Testing & Refinement**: Tested the implementation across different devices and browsers to ensure consistency and responsiveness.
